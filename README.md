# Android Splash screen with animations

Basic android splash screen with animations

For animation I used translate and alpha tags to control the positional and transparency animations.
For fonts I used google fonts like bad script, dancing script and kreon (bold and light).


The main thing is,
 I used handler to view the getStarted activity after the splash screen
 So What is handler ? 
       --> Suppose we want a piece of code to be executed after a few seconds suppose after 5 seconds then this action can be acheived by none other than handler.Now Handler uses runnable interfaces to run the message by using method postDelayed to delay the code execution.
